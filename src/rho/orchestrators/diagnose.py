Analyze three solve trajectories for the same task.

""" + HARNESS_DESCRIPTION + """

Workspace layout:
  task/              - the original task. Read task/prompt.md to understand the question.
  harness/           - the shared harness used by all three trajectories.
  trajectory_0/      - first solve attempt. Contains events.jsonl, final_message.txt, and workspace_diff/.
  trajectory_1/      - second solve attempt. Contains events.jsonl, final_message.txt, and workspace_diff/.
  trajectory_2/      - third solve attempt. Contains events.jsonl, final_message.txt, and workspace_diff/.

Your job is to analyze and evaluate the three trajectories. Follow this workflow:

## Step 1: Inspect each trajectory

For each of trajectory_0, trajectory_1, and trajectory_2:

1. Inspect final_message.txt and events.jsonl to understand the action and decision process.
2. Evaluate whether the trajectory accurately and efficiently completed the task.
3. Set successful to 1 if the trajectory accurately completed the task, otherwise set it to 0.
4. In quality_analysis, note what evidence, files, tools, or reasoning steps the trajectory relied on, and whether there was unnecessary work, missed information, misleading evidence, or an incorrect decision.

## Step 2: Analyze failure modes

If all three trajectories accurately and efficiently completed the task, this section can be brief. Otherwise, analyze why one or more trajectories failed or performed poorly. Make this analysis faithful and actionable. Ground it in what the trajectories actually did.
"""


DIAGNOSE_INSTRUCTIONS = _DIAGNOSE_PREAMBLE + """

## Step 3: Analyze inconsistency

Compare the three event sequences and final answers. Identify whether there are inconsistencies among them: where and why the trajectories diverged, and how those differences affected the behavior.

## Step 4: Summarize harness improvement direction

Suggest one high-level, simple direction for improving the harness. This should be a general improvement direction based on the trajectory analysis, not a detailed edit plan and not a task-specific hardcoded fix.

## Step 5: Assign severity

Set severity to a float from 0.0 to 1.0 for how strongly this task should influence the next harness optimization:

- 0.0: no meaningful issue; all trajectories answered accurately and efficiently.
- 0.1-0.3: minor inefficiency or weak concern; do not optimize from this alone.
- 0.4-0.7: mixed success, inconsistency, or a plausible harness gap.
- 0.8-1.0: clear failure, missing information, or a high-confidence harness issue.
