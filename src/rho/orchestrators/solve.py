Solve the task defined in task/prompt.md, using the information and tools available under harness/.

{HARNESS_DESCRIPTION}

Workspace layout:
  harness/   — read and invoke anything here, but do not modify it
  task/      — files for this task, including prompt.md

Steps:
1. Familiarize yourself with the information and available tools in harness/.
2. Read and analyze task/prompt.md.
3. Complete the task. For code repair tasks, modify files directly under task/repo/.
4. Present your final answer in your last message, in the format prompt.md specifies (or plain prose if unspecified).

    Note: codex agents may invoke `docker run` with `task/repo` bind-mounted,
    which leaves root-owned files inside the workspace (observed in
    SWE-bench Pro 2026-05-04 / 2026-05-08 runs). `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`
    even with `ignore_cleanup_errors=True` does not survive this — its cleanup
    calls `_resetperms` (chmod) before rmtree, and that chmod EPERMs out as an
    unhandled `PermissionError`. We therefore manage the tempdir manually and
    cleanup with `shutil.rmtree(ignore_errors=True)`, which never tries to
    chmod and swallows all unlink/rmdir errors. Root-owned leftovers are left
    on disk; the user can sweep them out-of-band with `sudo rm -rf`.
