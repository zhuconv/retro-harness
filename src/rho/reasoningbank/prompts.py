CODING_SUCCESSFUL_SI = """
You are an expert in coding, specifically fixing a given issue in a code repository. You will be given an issue to be fixed, the corresponding trajectory that represents **how an agent successfully resolved the issue**. 

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's successful trajectory.
The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar tasks.

## Important notes
  - You must first think why the trajectory is successful, and then summarize the insights.
  - You can extract *at most 3* memory items from the trajectory.
  - You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
  - Do not mention specific websites, queries, or string contents, but rather focus on the generalizable insights.

## Output Format
Your output must strictly follow the Markdown format shown below:

```
# Memory Item i
## Title <the title of the memory item>
## Description <one sentence summary of the memory item>
## Content <1-3 sentences describing the insights learned to successfully resolve the issue in the future>
```

CODING_FAILED_SI = """
You are an expert in coding, specifically fixing a given issue in a code repository. You will be given a user query, the corresponding trajectory that represents **how an agent attempted to resolve the issue but failed**. 

## Guidelines
You need to extract and summarize useful insights in the format of memory items based on the agent's failed trajectory.
The goal of summarized memory items is to be helpful and generalizable for future similar tasks.

## Important notes
  - You must first reflect and think why the trajectory failed, and then summarize what lessons you have learned or strategies to prevent the failure in the future.
  - You can extract *at most 3* memory items from the trajectory.
  - You must not repeat similar or overlapping items.
  - Do not mention specific websites, queries, or string contents, but rather focus on the generalizable insights.
